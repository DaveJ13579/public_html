    <h2><strong>The carpool</strong></h2>
    <p>Some harvests will have a carpool. Not all harvests will have one and when there is one it  is usually optional. The carpool works by setting a time and location where everyone in the carpool will meet before driving to the harvest. Volunteers join the carpool by indicating when they sign up whether they need a ride or can give rides to others. The software keeps track of how many rides are needed and how many extra ones are being offered. The <strong>Harvests</strong> page shows how many extra carpool seats are being offered. </p>
    <p>If you want a ride  in the carpool, check the box that says '<em>Check here if you want a carpool ride from another volunteer</em>.'</p>
    <p>If you can give a ride for one or more volunteers, put the number of extra seats that you can provide in the space that says '<em>If you can drive and provide extra seats for other volunteers, put the number of extra seats in the box.</em>' If you are offering a ride in the carpool, remember that someone else will be counting on you. </p>
    <p>If you need a seat in the carpool, but none is available yet, you will be put on the waiting list until someone signs up who can offer a ride. You will then be added to the harvest roster and sent an email with the details. Be aware that if you are getting a ride from someone else through the carpool and the person giving the ride has to cancel from the harvest, you may be bumped back to the waiting list. If this happens you will be sent an email, so it is important to check your email up until you leave for the carpool meeting spot.</p>
    <p>If you are on the waiting list because you need a ride, and then find that you can get to the harvest yourself, you can go to the harvests page and sign up again if there are still open spots on the roster. You will no longer be on the waiting list or in the carpool.    </p>
