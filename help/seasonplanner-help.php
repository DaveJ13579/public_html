        <h2><strong>Season Planner help</strong></h2>
        <p>The Season  Planner is the information center for all harvests. It has two views:  'Calendar' and 'List.' </p>
        <p><strong>Calendar View:</strong> The page opens in calendar view. If if is  accessed from the navigation bar link then it automatically positions itself to  the current week, although the entire year si viewable by scrolling. Harvests  are placed in order on the days that they happened or are scheduled. Mousing  over a harvest brings up the essential information about that harvest in the  Details Pane at the right. The harvest details can be changed by clicking on the harvest in calendar iew.</p>
      <p>The colors of harvests in the calendar view show the steps of the planning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pink: unscheduled and not yet assigned to a harvest leader 
          <table width="50" border="1" cellspacing="1">
          <tr style="background-color:#FCC"><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
          </li>
          <li>Yellow: unscheduled but a harvest leader has been assigned
          <table width="50" border="1" cellspacing="1">
          <tr style="background-color:#FFC"><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
			</li>
          <li>Blue: harvest date set and status is 'closed'
          <table width="50" border="1" cellspacing="1">
          <tr style="background-color:#CCF"><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
			</li>
          <li>Green: harvest date set and status is 'open' for public signup
          <table width="50" border="1" cellspacing="1">
          <tr style="background-color:#CFC"><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>List View:</strong> The list view can be selected by mousing  over the 'To List' square next to the filters. As with the Calendar View,  mousing over harvests on the list brings up information in the Details Pane at  the right. The date in the List View is either the actual harvest date (if the  harvest has been scheduled), or the date of the most recent harvest (if there  has been one) or the ripe date (if there has been no previous harvest). If the  harvest has not been scheduled, then its status appears as 'unsched.' The owner's name in list view is a link directly to the page to change harvest details.</p>
<p><strong>Details Pane:</strong> The right side pane shows details of the  most recent harvest that was moused over. There are links to pages to view or update  crop and harvest information. When appropriate, links to send bulk email notice  of the harvest or a crop owner survey request or compiling pdf pages of  donation receipt letters and envelopes appear there. </p>
        <p><strong>Filters: </strong>The list and calendar can filtered by Year,  Backyard or Farm, Status, or Sort direction using the four dropdown menus at  the top and then clicking on 'Submit.' The filter selections are saved for each  user and reloaded the next time the page is accessed. </p>
        <p>The Season  Planner draws from the harvests list, so adding rows is simply a matter of  making a new harvest on the<a href="../images/banners/banner-home.jpg"> Insert Harvest page</a> or by clicking on the 'add new harvest' link  in the <a href="../images/banners/banner-home.jpg">Crop list</a>.</p>
        <p>The columns show  the basic information about the harvest to help see at a glance the state of  planning for that harvest. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Status</strong> column may have three possible entries: </p>
      <p><strong>closed</strong> - This means that the harvest will not be  shown on the Harvests page for public signup. All harvests are 'closed'  when they are still in the planning stages. <br />
          <strong>open</strong> - This means that the harvest can be  displayed on the public Harvests page. To be displayed there it must also  have a leader assigned. Note: even if a harvest has the status 'open' it will  not appear on the Harvests page if all slots are filled or if the date  of the harvest has passed. <br />
          <strong>unscheduled </strong>â€“ The harvest is on the harvest list but does  not yet have an actual date. A harvest requires only a crop number to be  listed. On the calendar view, the harvest is placed by 1) the most recent  completed harvest of that crop if there was one or 2) the ripe date for the  crop. </p>
        <p>The Details Pane may include several links to view or update information about the crop and the harvest, plus two others:</p>
      <p><strong>Owner Survey link</strong><br />
      This appears <strong>only</strong> if the harvest is past, the total yield has been entered, the owner has an email address, and a survey has not already been sent for this harvest. The link goes to a page that contains a pre-composed email inviting the owner to complete a survey. The note can be edited before being sent. </p>
