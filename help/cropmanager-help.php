    <h2><strong>Crop Manager</strong></h2>
    <p>This page lists all of types of crops. You can add or change or delete crops on this page. The crops in this list are automatically listed in the crop dropdown menus in the Harvest Update page. If you will harvest a type of crop that is not listed in the dropdown menu then the Crop Manager is where you add it as a new crop,</p>
    <p><strong><em>NOTE: There are strict rules about the use of this page. Be careful when using it. Here's why:</em></strong></p>
    <p>All of the crop types of previous harvests are tied to this list by an index nuimber. If you change the name of an existing crop on the list, that changes what is shown as having been picked at all those previous harvests. If you delete a crop type, all previous harvests of that crop will have no way to look up what was picked and will be left with only the weight.</p>
    <p><strong>Add a new crop</strong>: Click the 'add a crop' button. a new line appears at the top of the form. Change -- New Crop -- to the name of the crop you are adding. You may add a typical ripeness date if you want but this field is not being used anywhere yet. CLick on the Update button for that row. The crop will appear in its alphabetical place and in the Harvest Update dropdown list.</p>
    <p><strong>Change the name of a crop</strong>: Simply type in the form and click on Update. This should be done <em><strong>only</strong></em> if needed to clarify a crop name or to correct a misspelling. The change will affect all previous harvests of this crop.</p>
    <p><strong>Delete a crop</strong>: <em><strong>Never </strong></em>delete a crop that has been previously harvested. If there is a question about this contact the webmaster to do a search. it is better to leave a crop that you have added unnecessarily than to delete it unless you are absolutely certain that it has never been harvested.</p>
    <p>If you ever make a change or deletion in this page and then realize that you have done it in error, contact the webmaster immediately to have the crops table restored from the latest backup. Hold your breath until that is successful.    </p>
