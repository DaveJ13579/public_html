    <h2><strong>Harvest information and Roster</strong>    </h2>
    <p>This page displays information about the harvest and has links to a few other pages. The top section has areas that show the Harvest details, Site details, Owner contact information and the history of harvests at this site.</p>
		 <p>The next section has the harvest leader and co-leader contact info. There are then two links that can be sent to volunteers to allow them to sign up directly for the harvest without going to the public page. This could be used if there is a harvest that the leader wants to select who attends rather than post it for public signup. </p>
		 <p>There are three links under that section:</p>
		 <p>Printable roster: Clicking on this opens a page that is formatted for directly printing on your printer that includes the information that you may need at the harvest, such as the roster. </p>
		 <p>Update harvest information: This goes directly back to the Harvest Update page.</p>
		 <p>Update site information: This goes directly to the Site Update page. </p>
		 <p>The bottom section includes the entire roster, including those that have cancelled and those that are on the waiting list. </p>
