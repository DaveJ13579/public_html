        <h2><strong>Maps help</strong></h2>
        <p>This page displays several maps chosen from the list at the top.</p>
        <p>The link to Update the maps is for webmaster use only. It links to a php script, ConstructCSVs.php that recompiles the lists from the database info and saves them as csv files in the /maps/ folder. These files must be manually uploaded to Google Drive under the piercecty@gleanweb.org signon. That is done by deleting all rows of each table and then adding all rows with the uploaded file. It is a little awkward, but the API for automatic uploads very complicated. UPDATE: This may now be automatic.</p>
