        <h2><strong>Harvest Insert help</strong></h2>
        <p>This page adds a  new harvest to the harvest list. Changing details about existing harvests is  done on the Harvest Update page. The only required field to initially add a new  harvest is the crop ID number. If you add (insert) a new harvest with only the  crop ID number, yopu can later add the rest of the information on the Harvest  Update page. <br />
        <strong>Filters</strong> can be used to display existing harvests.  Entering a harvest number or crop number in the filter, then clicking 'Show  records' will display all harvests meeting those criteria. This can save  typing, for instance, if you are adding a new harvest for a crop that was  harvested the previous year and most of the information is the same, such as  directions to the harvest. The changes for the new harvest can be made and  saved.</p>
        <p><strong>Fields</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Crop ID</strong> - The number assigned on the crop list to  the crop that will be harvested. </p>
        <p><strong>Coordinator,  Leader, and Co-leader ID</strong> -  The picker numbers for the people assigned to the harvest. Picker numbers can  be looked up using the Picker Finder at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p><strong>Harvest Date</strong> - Dates are entered using the format  'yyyy-mm-dd'. If the date is blank it will show up on the Season Planner as  'unscheduled.'</p>
        <p><strong>Time</strong> - The time of the harvest. This is entered from  a dropdown menu.<br />
          <strong> </strong><br />
          <strong>Type</strong> –  What kind of harvest such as Field, Pickup.</p>
        <p><strong>Pickers needed</strong> – How many roster slots will be available for signup.</p>
        <p><strong>Where donated</strong> - The food agency, such as Marion Polk Food  Share or Union Gospel </p>
        <p><strong>Status</strong> - A harvest <em>must</em> also have a status  to be added to the harvest list. This can be: </p>
        <p><strong>closed</strong> - This means that the harvest will not be  shown on the Harvest Parties page for public signup. <strong>open</strong> - This means  that the harvest can be displayed on the public Harvest Parties page. To be  displayed there it must also have a leader assigned. Note: even if a harvest  has the status 'open' it will not appear on the Harvest Parties page if all  slots are filled or if the date of the harvest has passed..</p>
        <p><strong>Tax date</strong> - The date that the tax donation receipt was  sent to the crop owner. This will normally not be known when the harvest is  first listed and will be left blank.</p>
        <p><strong>Meeting spot –</strong> the location the carpool participants will meet.</p>
        <p><strong>Carpool – </strong>Whether  there is no carpool, optional carpool, or required carpool.</p>
        <p><strong>Carpool time</strong> –  When the carpool will meet.</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-signup  info </strong>- This section is for  text about the harvest. It will be displayed in the Season Planner and so can  be used for short pieces of information before the harvest is scheduled, such  as noting that the harvest date is tentative, or who will be scouting the site.  However, when the harvest is opened for signup (status = 'open') then the text  in this section is shown with the open harvest list on the public Harvest  Parties page as a short description of the crop and location so volunteers can  decide if they want to sign up. </p>
        <p><strong>Post-signup  info</strong> - This section is for  text that will appear on the harvest information page that volunteers see after  they sign up for the harvest. It will be inserted on that page under 'Specific  information for this harvest'. It typically includes directions to the harvest,  what to bring, and special considerations about the site or crop. </p>
<p>There is a checkbox for &quot;Include Google Maps directions after signup:&quot; When a person signs up for a harvest they are sent to a page (hthank.php) that gives details about the harvest including the text of &quot;Long info.&quot; Traditionally this text has included directions to the harvest. If the checkbox is left checked then, when the hthank.php page is produced it will use the pickers' registered address and the harvest address to look up custom driving directions on Google Maps from the picker's house to the harvest, and insert them on the page. The option to uncheck this is there because there may be occasions when Google Maps cannot do that correctly. If this is the case, then simply unchecking the box in &quot;Harvest update&quot; will leave those directions off the page. It is recommended to leave the box checked and then sign up for the harvest (using the direct link) before opening the harvest and seeing if the directions are correct. </p>
