        <h2><strong>Send owner survey request help</strong></h2>
        <p>This page is reached from the 'Send Survey' link in the Season Planner. An email to the copr owner is pre-composed and displayed in the form. The message can be edited before being sent. However, <strong>do not</strong> edit the link that is included in the email. It is coded with the particular harvest number and must be sent as it appears in the email. </p>
        <p>Clicking on 'Send survey request' sends the email to the owner. </p>
